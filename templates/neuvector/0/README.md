NeuVector provides continuous network security for application containers. Deploy the NeuVector containers to get network visibility, application layer segmentation, Docker Bench auditing, and run-time vulnerability scanning.

NeuVector also detects host and container privilege escalations / break outs and application threats such as DDoS and DNS attacks.
